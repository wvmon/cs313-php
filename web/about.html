I am very passionate about coding and researching new methods in order to solve complex problems. Enjoy working on front-end development during my free time. I also tend to have a weakness towards sour and tasty snacks.</p>

                        As a programmer with a solid background in writing programs, who enjoys editing and designing webpages as a personal passion, my love and appreciation for technology and innovation runs deep. I have a good eve for detail and can spot bugs in mine and my colleague's code by practicing the rubber-duck theory.

                        I believe what sets me apart from the rest will be that I am motivated and self taught. I tutor myself in the discipline that arouses my interest and mostly that is unknown to me. Web development is a perfect example for that because I love to apply the newest features that popular and famous websites use.

                        I also believe in hard work but what's more important than working hard is working smart.  As programmers and engineers we have the desire to input the least amount of effort with the intention of outputting the best results.  Those that excel most in life are the ones that not only work hard but take it to the next step.
