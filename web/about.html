                        As a programmer with a solid background in writing programs, who enjoys editing and designing webpages as a personal passion, my love and appreciation for technology and innovation runs deep. I have a good eve for detail and can spot bugs in mine and my colleague's code by practicing the rubber-duck theory.

                        I believe what sets me apart from the rest will be that I am motivated and self taught. I tutor myself in the discipline that arouses my interest and mostly that is unknown to me. Web development is a perfect example for that because I love to apply the newest features that popular and famous websites use.

                        I also believe in hard work but what's more important than working hard is working smart.  As programmers and engineers we have the desire to input the least amount of effort with the intention of outputting the best results.  Those that excel most in life are the ones that not only work hard but take it to the next step.

                        As seen by the background images, I am an outdoor kind of person who loves mother nature.  I support gun rights along with its respoisbilities and obilagtions.  Have the eager to going on to adventure and places.  Aside from that I enjoy watching many genres of movies and love to play Xbox.  Sports are the best and every now and then I make a trip to the gym.
